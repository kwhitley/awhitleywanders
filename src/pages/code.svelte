  So, what do I mean by "elegant code"?
</p>

<p>
  I believe code should be self-documenting and human-readable.  Types and enforcement/rules are great and all, but the bottom line is,
  if you can glance quickly at a block of code and understand it, you're going to:
</p>

<ol>
  <li>Waste less time comprehending it.</li>
  <li>Waste less time comprehending it. (not a typo)</li>
  <li>Waste less time comprehending it. (still not a typo)</li>
</ol>

<p>
  This means your future self (or any others having to read through your code) will be able to quickly jump in, without staring blankly
  at the screen or wasting time looking up translations in the extensive how-to documentation that had to be included.
  As a lazy developer myself, I'd rather write code with readable names, obvious flow, not-overly-clever bits (I love code-golfing,
  but let's be real - it makes for an unreadable mess), and a minimal bit of commenting here and there.
</p>

<p>
  Much like a school paper or company memo, less is typically more.  No one <em>really</em> wants to read 5 lines, when one will suffice.
</p>

<p>
  As an open-source developer, I write libs to make downstream code lightweight, readable, and <em>obvious</em>.  As a mentor and technical
  advisor, I guide along this path as well!  To this point, I measure code success (of my own or others), not just on the technical merits of achieving the task,
  but also on the abilty for someone else to jump in and understand the intention/execution!
